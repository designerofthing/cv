        <p><em>Designer of Things...</em></p>
        <p>Steve Watson can be viewed as a designer equipped with artistic conceptualisation, there is a notable relaxed sensibility in his designs, a freedom of expression,
          a sense of humour.<br> He works comfortably across a variety of materials, from glass, wood, concrete, metals to plastics, blending them together as effortlessly as he blends ideas.
          <br>Continuing themes of symbiosis and juxtaposition run through his work as they are continuing themes in his life.<br> A belief in engaging the user of his designs in a conscious way
          forms the basis of every product/project he approaches.<br> This engagement is evident as humour, hidden forms, perspectives and double meanings that pervade the relationship created
          between the design via the product and the user. </p>
